    <h1>A Little History of the World Wide Web</h1>
    <p><em>See also<a href=""> How It All Started</a>presentation materials from the <a href="">W3C 10th Anniversary Celebration</a> and <a href="">other references</a>.</em>
        </p>
        <br>from 1945 to 1995
        <br/>
        <h2>1945</h2>
        <p>Vannevar Bush writes <a href="">an article</a>  in <a href="">Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche</p>
    <h2>1960s</h2>
    <p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the <a href="">Bootstrap Institute library</a>.<br><br>

        Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in <em>A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate</em> . 20th National Conference, New York, <a href="">Association for Computing Machinery</a>, 1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.
        
    </br> <br>Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.</p>
    <h2>1980</h2>
    <p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See: <a href="">Enquire user manual as scanned images</a> or as <a href="">HTML page(alt)</a>.
